# Re-Former

This app is a practice app in order to get familiar with rails in-built form helpers. The goal of this project is to build forms the traditional way (with html) and with rails helpers. 

This project is part of [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/forms), a curriculum to learn full stack web development.
